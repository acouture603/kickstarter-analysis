# Kickstarting with Excel

Kickstarter Analysis â€“ Challenge 1


## Overview of Project

This project consists of analyzing the Kickstarter dataset collected from various campaigns. 


### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their fundraising goals.  There will be two analyses; outcomes based on launch dates, and outcomes based on goals. 


## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge encountered was the countifs statements did not tally up correctly.  In teh dataset I checked the counts by filtering the data only to find that I was missing a range in my new table.  Once that was corrected, the totals matched for the overall analysis.  Data entry and attention to detail is imperative.  A simple, one range missing can derail results analysis if you are not careful to backcheck the work. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    Conclusion 1:  The best time of the year (month) for successful Theater outcomes is May
    
    Conclusion 2: There are substantailly more successful plays than there are cancelled or failed throughout the year

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    Conclusion: Oucomes are more sucessful between Goals range of $0 to $4999, and all outcomes fail (0% successful) between goal amount of 45000 to 49000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    Analyzes all theatre productions subcategories in all countries.  There could be outliers in a month during a given year that are not noticed.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    Analyzing the data based on region, year or subcategory could provide more useful inforamtion based on goal of usign data.  Box and whisker plot could provide more detailed informtion in these instances.  A bar chart could depict statistics for a subcategory of overall outcomes in a region.
